 Like you, be strong, to hold the powers of the Sun<br>
  To dream, believe in strength<br>
 Now I’m the only one, only one<br>
    <br>
 I was an ordinary boy<br>
 Until I broke the rules<br>
 My life destroyed, my life destroyed<br>
 Until I woke awake, scream my mind<br>
    <br>
 I shout, the ground shakes<br>
 How much can I take?<br>
 My mind will break<br>
 Will it break?<br>
 What can I take?<br>
 Can I be your superhero?<br>
 Superhero<br>
    <br>
 Can I be your superhero?<br>
 Superhero, superhero, superhero<br>
    <br>
 Fly up, away, it’s the first time of today, today<br>
 To dream, believe you are the strength<br>
 You’re all I need, need, need
 Oh, gonna give it a shot, only one of me<br>
 To shoot you off from the enemy<br>
 Your superhero<br>
 Your superhero<br>
    <br>
 Can I be your superhero?<br>
 Superhero, superhero, superhero<br>
<p> Can I be your superhero?<br>
